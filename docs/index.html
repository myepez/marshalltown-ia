                        Created by Marco A. Yepez-Gomez. Not employed by City of Marshalltown or Marshall County. This project is meant to be lived and enjoyed in the public
                        domain for whatever use.

                    <h2>Property Tax Rates</h2>
                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        I created these 3D visualizations to help the public and city representatives view Marshalltown's tax rates in a more accessible format than
                        traditional spreadsheets. My goal is to help decision-makers identify which areas have developed into valuable properties that contribute to
                        Marshalltown's wealth, and which areas need support to become stronger contributors to our city.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        The City of Marshalltown and Marshall County staff generously provided CSV files containing approximately 11,000 records from the year 2023 with
                        parcel IDs, acres, addresses, and property tax totals. The raw data required cleaning before processing. About 500 records were removed where the
                        data was ambiguous and would have required speculation to interpret. I used Google Spreadsheets and Python scripts to clean the bulk of the data,
                        while manually verifying about 500 records using Google Maps and the Beacon web application. All data points can be independently verified by
                        checking parcel IDs or addresses through the publicly accessible Beacon application and the interactive map.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Maps</h3>
                    <p>
                        The maps below use coordinates found using the Python library Nominatim and the addresses provided. Each coordinate height is determined by the tax rate
                        the coordinate pays. The tax rate is calculated by the ratio of the total paid in 2023 and the size of the land in acres. Coordinates that are red mean that
                        they participate at a $22,600/acre tax rate that is sustainable for a city $120 M/year budget. Coordinates turn yellow the further they are from the rate.
                    </p>
