                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the motivations for retrieving this data and 3D visualizing it in maps was so the public and their representatives could see the tax rates
                        of the City of Marshalltown in a more pleasant manner than traditional views like a CSV file. One of my dream goals is to help representatives in
                        power understand what areas have flourished to become valuable properties and contribute to the wealth of Marshalltown, IA, and also see
                        which areas are struggling to develop into properties that become strong contributors to the city.

                    <h3>Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        The City of Marshalltown and Marshall County staff were kind enough to provide the following year 2023 ~11,000 records information in CSV files: parcel IDs,
                        acres, addresses, and property tax totals data. The data was not ready to be processed immediately and needed to be cleaned. Cleaning involved
                        removing about 500 records due to the data being hard to properly make sense of without making personal guesses. Tools like Google Spreadsheet
                        and Python scripting were used to clean the data at a scale and about 500 records were manually cleaned using Google Maps and the web
                        application Beacon. The work can be verified using the parcel IDs or addresses when highlighting records on the map and the Beacon
                        application available to the public.
                    </p>
