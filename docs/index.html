                        Created by Marco A. Yepez-Gomez. Not employed by City of Marshalltown or Marshall County. This project is meant to be lived and enjoyed in the public
                        domain for whatever use.

                    <h2>Property Tax Rates</h2>
                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        I created these 3D visualizations to help the public and city representatives view Marshalltown's tax rates in a more accessible format than
                        traditional spreadsheets. My goal is to help decision-makers identify which areas have developed into valuable properties that contribute to
                        Marshalltown's wealth, and which areas need support to become stronger contributors to our city.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        The City of Marshalltown and Marshall County staff generously provided CSV files containing approximately 11,000 records from the year 2023 with
                        parcel IDs, acres, addresses, and property tax totals. The raw data required cleaning before processing. About 500 records were removed where the
                        data was ambiguous and would have required speculation to interpret. I used Google Spreadsheets and Python scripts to clean the bulk of the data,
                        while manually verifying about 500 records using Google Maps and the Beacon web application. All data points can be independently verified by
                        checking parcel IDs or addresses through the publicly accessible Beacon application and the interactive map.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Map</h3>
                    <p>
                        The map below is generated using coordinates derived from the Python library Nominatim based on the provided addresses. Each coordinate's
                        height reflects the corresponding tax rate, which is calculated as the ratio of the total taxes paid in 2023 to the land size in acres. Key
                        statistics for the tax rate data are as follows:<br>

                        <br>
                        Lower Boundary: $-5,369.62/acre<br>
                        Lower Quartile: $4,924.10/acre<br>
                        Median: $8,403.70/acre<br>
                        Upper Quartile: $11,786.58/acre<br>
                        Upper Boundary: $22,080.30/acre<br>
                        <br>

                        On the map, red indicates areas with tax rates closer to the upper boundary, representing the highest tax rates in town. In contrast, yellow
                        highlights areas with rates further from the upper boundary, indicating the lowest tax rates.
